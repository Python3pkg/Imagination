**Imagination** is a reusable component framework whose objectives are:

* encapsulates an object into a single object with the lazy loader, inspired by many frameworks,
* improves code maintainability by encapsulating reusable components (or dependencies) in a global memory, inspired by JavaBeans
* introduce the concept of the aspect-oriented programming, inspired by AspectJ.

.. note::
    Imagination plays a big role in Tori Web Framework dealing with clean
    routing and globally referencing to any defined reusable components.
