Getting started
###############

**Imagination 2** introduces much improvement over the first major version.
Here is the highlight.

* **Enhancements:**
    * Simplify and streamline the setup.
    * PyPy3 support is coming up soon in this major release (but not
      for Imagination 2.0).
* **Bug:**
    * Address possible infinite recursion caused by proxy entities
      (`Issue #24 <https://github.com/shiroyuki/Imagination/issues/24>`_).
* **Backward Incompatibility:**
    * **Imagination 2 drops the support for Python 2.7
      and 3.3 for good.** If you need to use with Python 2.7, please consider
      Imagination 1.30+ (`pip install install imagination==1.30`) or upgrade
      your code to be compatible to at least Python 3.5.
