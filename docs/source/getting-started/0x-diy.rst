The documentation is nowhere perfect. It might miss something. Or the code might
not work as documented. You may figure it out by yourself by reading the source
code as the source code is open-source.

If you are very lazy, please feel free to `create a ticket on GitHub
<https://github.com/shiroyuki/Imagination/issues>`_ with a tag **question** for
any questions or suggestions about the framework.

If you actually find a bug, please also feel free to create a ticket on
`GitHub <https://github.com/shiroyuki/Imagination/>`_ with a tag **bug**.

If you want to contribute, please feel free to create a pull request on GitHub.
