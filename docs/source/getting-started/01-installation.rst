Installation
############

You mean install with ``pip install imagination`` or from the source directly
(for those who are adventurous enough to live on the edge)::

    git clone https://github.com/shiroyuki/Imagination.git
    cd Imagination
    pip install -IU .

.. note::

    If your system has **pip** for multiple versions of Python, please use the
    one for the version you want to work with. For example::

        # For Python3 in general
        pip3 install -IU .

        # For Python 3.5
        pip-3.5 install -IU .
