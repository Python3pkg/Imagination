This is specific for the test of dependency injection on actionable events and
super lazy loaders allowing any arbitery order of entity declaration.

Schema::

    EVENT=(before|pre|post|after)

    <interception
        EVENT=REFERENCE_ENTITY_IDENTIFIER
        do=REFERENCE_ENTITY_METHOD
        with=THIS_ENTITY_METHOD
    >
        PARAMETERS
    </interception>

where:
* REFERENCE_ENTITY_IDENTIFIER is the reference's entity identifier
* REFERENCE_ENTITY_METHOD is the reference's method name
* THIS_ENTITY_METHOD is this entity's method name
* EVENT is where the REFERENCE_ENTITY_METHOD is intercepted.
  * 'before' is an event before the execution of the method of the reference
    (reference method) regardless to the given arguments to the reference
    method.
  * 'pre' is an event on pre-contact of the reference method and concerning
    about the arguments given to the reference method. The method of the entity
    (the intercepting method) takes the same paramenter as the reference method.
  * 'post' is an event on post-contact of the reference method and concerning
    about the result returned by the reference method. The intercepting method
    for this event takes only one parameter which is the result from the
    reference method or any previous post-contact interceptors.
  * 'after' is an event after the execution of the reference method regardless
    to the result reterned by the reference method.
